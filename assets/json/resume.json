      "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions are heterogeneous with regard to inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury, and neuronal loss. We previously developed a diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to better address MS lesion heterogeneity. We hypothesized that the profiles of multiple DBSI metrics can identify lesion-defining patterns. Here we test this hypothesis by combining a deep learning algorithm using deep neural network (DNN) with DBSI and other imaging methods."

While conventional MRI has been widely adopted to examine GBM clinically, accurate neuroimaging assessment of tumor histopathology for improved diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment evaluation remains an unmet need in the clinical management of GBMs. We employ a novel diffusion histology imaging (DHI) approach, combining diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) and machine learning, to detect, differentiate, and quantify areas of high cellularity, tumor necrosis, and tumor infiltration in GBM"

      "summary": "High-grade pediatric brain tumors have the highest mortality rates among children. Conventional MRI is commonly used for clinical examination, but accurately detecting and distinguishing tumor types remains a challenge. We introduced a novel approach called Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) using diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) metrics to train a deep neural network. DHI aims to identify and quantify different tumor components such as normal white matter, dense and less dense tumor regions, infiltrating edges, necrosis, and hemorrhage. By combining DBSI metrics and deep learning, we achieved an 85.8% accuracy in classifying pediatric tumor histology."
