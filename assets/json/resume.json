We previously developed a diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to better address MS lesion heterogeneity. We hypothesized that the profiles of multiple DBSI metrics can identify lesion-defining patterns. Here we test this hypothesis by combining a deep learning algorithm using deep neural network (DNN) with DBSI and other imaging methods."

      "summary": "High-grade pediatric brain tumors have the highest mortality rates among children. Conventional MRI is commonly used for clinical examination, but accurately detecting and distinguishing tumor types remains a challenge. We introduced a novel approach called Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI) using diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) metrics to train a deep neural network. DHI aims to identify and quantify different tumor components such as normal white matter, dense and less dense tumor regions, infiltrating edges, necrosis, and hemorrhage. By combining DBSI metrics and deep learning, we achieved an 85.8% accuracy in classifying pediatric tumor histology."
