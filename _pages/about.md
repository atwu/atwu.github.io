Hello! My name is Anthony T Wu, a second year in the MSTP (MD/PhD) program at the University of California, Irvine. I received my B.S. from Washington University in St. Louis in Biomedical Engineering with a second major in Computer Science. Not sure why this isn't showing up.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
